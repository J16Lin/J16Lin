### Hi there 👋
# Welcome to my about me page!
My name is Jeff and I am an aerospace engineering student at Iowa State University!
I want to learn to code better from this course! I am currently a senior and am expected to graduate 2023!

My favorite hobbies include music festivals, traveling, skiing, photography, but I honestly love doing anything with my friends.
